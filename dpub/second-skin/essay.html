      <div class="text">
        <div class="rightcol">
          <h1> ELIZABETH SIEGEL 17/4/19 </h1>
          <p>Envision a world where your face cream is tailor-made for your DNA, your hair mask knows you got highlights last Thursday, and your serum has a better handle on your likes, your dislikes — even what you had for breakfast — than your partner. Innovators from the worlds of tech and beauty are dreaming up these hyperpersonalized beauty products right now, and they’ll be in our hands as early as this year. If half — hell, if a quarter — of the predictions in this story pan out, the next generation of lipsticks and hydrators will be virtually unrecognizable.</p> <br>

        <p>In the next year...
        High-tech sheet masks: Yes, they make skin dewy fast — but if you buy one that’s not the best fit for your face, they can also cause serum to leak into your eyes and get uncomfortably close to your mouth. A first-world problem, yes, but annoying enough that Neutrogena has created 3-D-printed sheet masks, called Neutrogena MaskID, that are tailored to your face shape. (They’ll be available before the end of 2019.)</p><br>


        <p>“The same facial-recognition technology that lets you open your iPhone X by looking at your screen also allows us to scan and create a 3-D model of your face in our app,” says Michael Southall, global research and development lead for beauty tech and devices at Johnson & Johnson. To print the customized sheet masks, he and his team partnered with experts who specialize in 3-D-printing artificial joints. Maybe even more exciting? The ingredients are also customized. “We can put different ingredients on different facial zones — forehead, cheeks, around the eyes,” says Southall.</p><br>

        <p>Neutrogena already has an iPhone attachment, the 360 Skin Scanner, that uses sensors to measure moisture levels on various parts of the face and imaging technology to track wrinkle depth and pore size. Based on these readings, the new MaskID app will recommend ingredient combinations for different facial zones (five ingredients, including hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, will be available at launch). “The possibilities are almost infinite,” says Southall.</p> <br>

          <p>3D-printed foundation: The Opté Precision Skin System looks like an old-school handheld inventory scanner. But at this year’s CES convention in Las Vegas (aka the tech expo to end all tech expos), “it was one of the most impressive things I saw at the entire show,” says Sharon Profis, an executive editor at CNET. Instead of reading bar codes, the wireless device — about the size of an electric razor — scans your face with blue light to identify age spots and pimples, uses a facial-recognition algorithm to determine each blemish’s size, shape, and color, and then prints the perfect amount of foundation over them (it’s spot coverage, not a full face of makeup).</p> <br>

          <p>The Opté is essentially a 3-D makeup printer: It’s got a mini ink-jet that squirts out teeny droplets of foundation (each one finer than a strand of hair) to cover spots, pointillism-style, until they are seamlessly hidden. “It’s difficult to print makeup onto the face with any real accuracy,” says Phill Dickens, a professor of manufacturing technology at the University of Nottingham in England. Printing foundation, which can blend into the surrounding skin, makes much more sense than printing something that’s got to be precise, like eyeliner, onto your face. “They demoed this device on my colleague at CES, and it worked so well it was insane,” says Profis. “It gave her spotless, smooth skin.” The foundation (which Opté calls a Tone Perfecting Serum) is infused with skin-brightening, anti-inflammatory niacinamide to fade sun spots and pimples over time and comes in three sheer shades (Fair, Medium, and Deep).</p> <br>

          <p>In the next few years...<br>
          Skin care at a genetic level: Just as a saliva sample can trace your ancestry, it could also be used to predict how your skin will age — and how to reverse course — based on an evaluation of your genetic makeup, says cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson. As we get older or are exposed to the sun, for example, certain genes flip on — “they trigger enzymes that break down collagen, causing wrinkles and sagging. But if you realize that’s happening on a molecular level, you could use prescription ingredients to quiet your overactive genes and normalize your skin,” says Wilson. And she’s not talking about the skin-care ingredients we already know and love. “I’m talking about pharmaceutical companies developing new topical drugs to upregulate and downgrade overactive or underactive genes in your skin,” she adds.</p> <br>

        

          <p>And just like that, the key to truly smooth skin could be written in your DNA. Some companies, like HomeDNA and Skintelli, have already started recommending existing skin-care ingredients and products for users based on DNA testing. They claim to give insight into how quickly your skin cells turn over or the quality of your collagen. “More studies need to be done in this area, and we should see how the FDA weighs in on it, though it’s heading in the right direction,” says Wilson. “Your genetic analysis could also tell you what kinds of foods to eat for younger, more radiant skin.” (Researchers in Israel are already studying nutrigenomics, a new field in which genetics inform diet.) And all of this could happen sooner than you think: “We could all be spitting in tubes for younger skin in the next few years, maybe even sooner,” Profis predicts.<p> <br>

          <p>In the next five+ years...<br>
          Skin analysis at the drugstore: Instant glow! Plumper skin! Before we get to 2030, such claims will be easily fact-checked. Wilson predicts drugstores will have the same skin-analysis machines currently found only in doctors’ offices and labs. “There’s so much you can’t see with the naked eye. These machines will measure oil and hydration levels, track wrinkle depth, and show pigment that’s waiting, in deep layers of skin, to become sun spots,” she says.</p> <br>

          <p>Based on all of these measurements, you’ll get targeted product recommendations (across brands) for your skin’s unique needs, down to different products for specific areas of your face. You’ll use your new routine for a few weeks and — this part is key — go back to get a new reading to see, proof-positive, whether your new regimen is working. (And yes, it is possible for the right formulas to make a measurable difference in wrinkle depth, skin tone and texture, and radiance and hydration in as little as three weeks.) “It will take away the placebo effect and subjectivity that’s wrapped up with skin care, and the misconception that the same formulas deliver for everyone,” says Wilson. “The one that’s great for my skin could do absolutely nothing for you.” And until these professional-grade machines become widely available, brands like Unilever’s new Skinsei will recommend products based on results of self-assessment surveys you fill out online.</p> <br>
