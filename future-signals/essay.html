      <div class="title"> THE FUTURE OF WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY</div>
      <div class="text">
        <h1>JEN QUINLAN, RITHMIO 23 / 8 / 19</h1>

       <p> I have a confession to make. Despite my specialization in wearable technology, I haven’t worn my FitBit in months. I’m not the only one.Many people found the first wave of wearables came up short. Entry-level price points were high, form factors were clodgy and accuracy left a lot to be desired. It’s no wonder there was a 30% return rate and high product abandonment after six months. </p>

        <p>Companies found getting wearables “right” is a tall order. To be truly useful, usable and desirable for people, we’ll see the following future improvements in wearable tech products to come in 2015 and beyond.</p>

        <p>Invisible. Moore’s Law contends that as components get smaller, products gain efficiency and become more powerful. In other words, you can think of current wearables as a boombox on your wrist. Between conductive fabrics or sensor-clad smart garments, wearables will intertwine so closely with fashion we won’t be able to distinguish them apart.Companies like AiQ Clothing, Hexoskin and OMsignal are already paving the way with biometric garments that measure body vitals. Future wearables could be more hidden by adding a thin film inside your favorite jewelry to measure biometric data, activity levels and even let you know when you’ve been typing at a keyboard too long.</p>
